# Exercise 6: map advanced

Given an array of tv shows, we want to create 3 new arrays:

- One including only the titles of the movies
- One including objects that include only the `title` and the `rating` properties
- One including only the titles of the movies, but:
  - If the rating is greater or equal to 9, we put the title in upper case.
  - Else, we make the title lower case.

Create this 3 arrays using the `map` method.
`console.log` the newly created arrays to finish. Verify that they are including the correct numbers.
